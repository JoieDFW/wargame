This is a simple version of the card game War.
The rules are simple, once half the deck is delt to each player (The user and the computer), 
each player flips their top card. The winner gets to take both cards. 
If there is a tie (Both players play the same number), war is declared, each player puts three more 
cards into the pot, and then flips their top card to determine the winner. The winner then takes the entire pot.
Play continues until one player runs out of cards in their hand and in their reserve.
